    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, I'm <strong>Mihir D Rajapurohit</strong>!</p>
    <p>I'm passionate about the world of web designing and project development. With a keen interest in creating visually appealing and highly functional websites, I've dedicated myself to mastering the art and science behind it. My journey in web designing started as a curiosity, and over the years, it has evolved into a full-fledged passion.</p>

    <h3>My Journey</h3>
    <p>My fascination with web design began during my early encounters with the internet. I was captivated by how websites could communicate, engage, and create experiences. This curiosity led me to explore various aspects of web development, from front-end design to back-end programming. Over time, I've gained a comprehensive understanding of the web design process, including user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design principles.</p>

    <h3>Skills and Expertise</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML & CSS: Crafting clean, responsive, and visually appealing layouts.</li>
        <li>JavaScript: Adding interactivity and enhancing user engagement.</li>
        <li>Frameworks: Working with popular frameworks like React and Angular to build dynamic web applications.</li>
        <li>Design Tools: Proficiency in design tools such as Adobe XD, Figma, and Photoshop to create stunning visuals and mockups.</li>
        <li>SEO: Implementing best practices to ensure websites are search engine optimized.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <p>I've worked on various projects that showcase my abilities in web design and development. From personal blogs to business websites, each project has been an opportunity to push my creative and technical boundaries. I take pride in delivering projects that not only meet but exceed client expectations.</p>

    <h3>Vision</h3>
    <p>My goal is to continue evolving as a web designer and developer, constantly exploring new technologies and trends. I aim to create websites that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also provide an intuitive and seamless user experience. I believe that good design has the power to make a positive impact, and I'm excited to contribute to that through my work.</p>
